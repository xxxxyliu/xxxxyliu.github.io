<br>
I am a second-year Master's student at the [School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), where I conduct research under the supervision of Professor [Licheng Jiao](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/lchjiao/index.html) at the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding (IPIU Lab), Ministry of Education.

## 💫Research Interests💫
- Referring Image Segmentation
- Vision-Language Understanding
- Computer Vision

My current research focuses on *Referring Image Segmentation* and *Remote Sensing Image Interpretation*. Beyond these areas, I am actively exploring *video understanding*, *Large Language Models (LLMs)*, and *reinforcement learning (RL)*.I maintain a strong enthusiasm for multimodal systems and scene understanding, and I am keen to explore emerging interdisciplinary domains. <br>
<!-- I am particularly interested in exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Scene Understanding**, with a growing enthusiasm for multimodal large-scale models. -->

I regularly publish Chinese technical blogs on CSDN, with cumulative readership exceeding 40,000 views. Welcome to follow my [CSDN account](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_45863274).<br>

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Fall 2026. If you are interested in my academic profile or potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out via 📧Email at xxxxyliu@stu.xidian.edu.cn </font>**
