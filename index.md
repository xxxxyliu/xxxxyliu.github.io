# Xinyu Liu (åˆ˜æ¬£é›¨)

<img src="https://xxxxyliu.github.io/images/xinyu.jpg" class="floatpic"> 


I am a second-year Master's student at theÂ [School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), where I conduct research under the supervision of ProfessorÂ [Licheng Jiao](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/lchjiao/index.html)Â at the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding (IPIU Lab), Ministry of Education.

My current research focuses onÂ **Referring Image Segmentation**Â andÂ **Remote Sensing Image Interpretation**Â in the domain of computer vision. I am particularly interested in exploringÂ **Multi-modality Understanding**,Â **Large Language Models (LLMs)**,Â **Reinforcement Learning**, andÂ **Scene Understanding**, with a growing enthusiasm for multimodal large-scale models.

Beyond academia, I actively share technical insights through Chinese blogs on [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_45863274), accumulating over 40,000 total views.<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, please feel free to contact me via [email](xxxxyliu@stu.xidian.edu.cn) or in person.
