<br>
I am a second-year Master's student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), where I conduct research under the supervision of Professor [Licheng Jiao](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/lchjiao/index.html) at the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding (IPIU Lab), Ministry of Education. Here is my [resume](https://xxxxyliu.github.io/file/250413-cv-1.pdf).

## 💫Research Interests💫
- Referring Image Segmentation
- Vision-Language Understanding
- Computer Vision

My current research focuses on *Referring Image Segmentation* and *Remote Sensing Image Interpretation*. Beyond these areas, I am actively exploring *Video understanding*, *Visual Language Understanding*, and *Visual Language Model*. I maintain a strong enthusiasm for multimodal systems and scene understanding, and I am keen to explore emerging interdisciplinary domains. <br>
<!-- I am particularly interested in exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Scene Understanding**, with a growing enthusiasm for multimodal large-scale models. -->

I regularly publish Chinese technical blogs on CSDN, with cumulative readership exceeding 40,000 views. Welcome to follow my [CSDN account](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_45863274).<br>
