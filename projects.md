</div>

This is a wheelchair specifically designed for patients with hand and foot difficulties such as ALS. <br>
This wheelchair controls its own movement by collecting information from patients' eyeballs, thereby solving the problem of difficult travel for patients. At the same time, the wheelchair uses LiDAR to collect surrounding environmental information, and uses differential algorithms to estimate the position of the wheelchair, thereby achieving automatic driving of the wheelchair indoors.
Main functions:
(1) Eye controlled movement: It can collect information from the eyeballs to control the movement of the wheelchair.
(2) Indoor autonomous driving: Using LiDAR to achieve autonomous driving indoors.
(3) Voice and music listening: For patients who are unable to speak, they can use their eyes to control the wheelchair and send customized voice messages, such as "I want to eat" and "I want to drink water". At the same time, patients can choose the songs to play by moving their eyes.
### My job responsibilities:
- **Wrote the User Manual**: Developed detailed documentation to guide users on how to operate and utilize the wheelchair's features.
- **Optimized Eye-Control Algorithms**: Improved the eye-tracking control algorithms, enhancing system responsiveness and accuracy.
- **Microcontroller Integration**: Successfully connected and integrated microcontrollers, ensuring stable communication between hardware and software.
